# How-To-SQL
After taking INFO 430, by Greg Hay, I've compiled a list of bare structures for important SQL queries, sprocs, UDFs, temporary objects, and other SQL code. 

I have also compiled a list of most of the SQL concepts I have learned over the course of the quarter that complements the technical side of SQL with a more conceptual understanding of the language on Quizlet at this link: https://quizlet.com/848338026/sql-concepts-flash-cards/?i=4a0l7d&x=1jqt
